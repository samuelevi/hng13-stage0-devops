Short description of my project
This project is my submission for the HNG DevOps Stage 0 challenge. The goal is to set up a live web server using NGINX on an AWS EC2 instance and make it publicly accessible. I customized a the simple HTML page to reflect the deployment details, my details and hosted it on port 80, just like I'd do in a real production environment. Along the way, I documented everything in a GitHub repository bringing cloud setup, server configuration, and version control into one experience.
